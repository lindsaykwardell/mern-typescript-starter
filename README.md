## Node/React/Express/Typescript Starter

Basic starter for a full stack application using NodeJS, Express, React (create-react-app), and Typescript.

### Commands

- dev: Live development of both client and server
- build: Builds both the server and client

Note: I stripped create-react-app default template down a bit, and it now does a fetch query against the server to prove that it's connected.
